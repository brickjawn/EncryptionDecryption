# Java Encryption/Decryption Tool

## Overview
This Java application provides a simple interface for encrypting and decrypting strings using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. It's designed as an educational tool to demonstrate basic cryptographic operations in Java.

## Features
- Encrypt user-input strings using AES encryption
- Decrypt previously encrypted strings
- Command-line interface for easy interaction

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files (included by default in newer JDK versions)

## Usage
1. Run the application
2. Choose from the following options:
   - 1: Encrypt a string
   - 2: Decrypt a string
   - 3: Exit the program
3. Follow the prompts to input your string for encryption or decryption

## Security Note
This tool is for educational purposes only. For real-world applications, consider using more robust key management and encryption practices.
